# Exploratory Data Analysis in Python: A Deep Dive into DataPrep and Manual Steps



In the realm of data analysis, understanding and visualizing the structure and characteristics of our dataset is paramount. 
This document delves into two approaches for conducting exploratory data analysis in Python: one through the "dataprep" library and the other involving manual steps.

## DataPrep Report Analysis

The "dataprep" library provides an efficient tool for visually and concisely performing exploratory data analysis. Below are highlighted steps taken with the "DataPrep Report":

- **Data Loading:**
  - We leverage "dataprep" data loading functionality to load our dataset.

- **Initial Exploration:**
  - We generate an initial exploratory data analysis report using "DataPrep Report" to obtain descriptive statistics and automatic visualizations.

- **Handling Missing Values:**
  - We identify the presence of missing values in the dataset and assess how to handle them.

- **Dimensions and Data Types:**
  - We gain insights into the dimensions and data types present in the dataset.

- **Random Sampling Visualization:**
  - We use interactive visualizations to explore 10 random samples from our dataset.

- **Correlation Analysis and Outliers:**
  - We examine correlations between variables and detect potential outliers.

## Manual Python Analysis

In contrast, we can also conduct exploratory data analysis manually in Python, using a combination of libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy. Here are the steps performed manually:

- **Loading and Initial Pandas DataFrame Analysis:**
  - We load the dataset using Pandas and perform an initial analysis.

- **Random Sampling:**
  - We take 10 random samples to understand the dataset's composition.

- **Transposing Dataset Visualization:**
  - We visualize the transposed dataset to gain a broader view.

- **Identifying Missing Values:**
  - We determine the existence of missing values and consider handling strategies.

- **Descriptive Statistics:**
  - We calculate descriptive statistics such as minima, maxima, means, and percentiles.

- **Exploring Bias:**
  - We analyze bias through measures such as mean and median.

This document provides a comprehensive comparison between the efficiency and convenience of using "DataPrep Report" and the in-depth analysis obtained through manual steps in Python. The choice between these approaches depends on the specific analysis needs and user preferences.
