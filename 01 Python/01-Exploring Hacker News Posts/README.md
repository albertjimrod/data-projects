# Hacker News Post


## Project Description.

It is intended to make a brief study of the community [Hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) through the posts as well as the type of users that make it up to know which are the most frequent posts, which are the most voted by the community, who are the users who have more relevance in the community and what are their interventions in it.

The main aim was working with variables, data types, lists, for loops, conditional statements, dictionaries, frequency tables, and functions in Python. By way of learning, building the functions to obtain the results has been very interesting and challenging.

The analysis has led me to realize that it is clearly a community committed to technology and I would say that even impartial because I have been able to verify how it is not necessary to be one of the people who write the most to stand out, on the contrary here quality is rewarded



## Table of Contents.

Users submit Ask posts to ask the community a specific question, and users also submit Show posts to show a project, product, or just something interesting.

 A number of questions have then been raised to understand a little better the character of the community.

 1. Finding posts starting with `Ask` and `Show`
 2. Average and maximum number of comments for `Ask` and `Show` posts
 3. Titles of the highest score for `Ask` and `Show` posts
 4. Finding the number of `Ask` comments posted by hour
 5. Posts created at a certain time, receive more comments on average.
 6. Most relevant authors in ``Ask` post
 7. What are the most significant activity by user in `Ask` post?
 8. What are the most significant activity by user in `Show` posts?
 9. Who has been the most voted, when, and title of the post?
 10. Summary


## Installation and libraries:

`python                    3.8.2`

In the file `conda_list.txt` are all the function libraries that I have used.
